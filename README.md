# Projects
 -> We implement an automatic technique that takes a single outdoor image as input
and hallucinate the image getting the same scene at a different time of the day.
-> We match the input image globally to time-lapse videos of similar scenes and find a
dense correspondence based on a Markov random field.
-> After getting a pair of time-lapse frames (frame at target time and at the time of the
given image) we transfer the appearance variation between the time-lapse frames to
the input image.
